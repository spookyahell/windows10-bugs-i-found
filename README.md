Possibly/maybe. I'm tired sometimes, that could lead to errors of judgment and bugs could turn out to be misbehavior of my own.

Also, may not be using the latest version of the OS at time of report.

- When I shutdown my computer it switches to tell me I still have apps open, I click cancel, it shuts down nonetheless.

- When I shutdown my computer it switches to tell me I still have apps open, I click cancel, it calims to be shutting down for a second, then cancels.

- None (yet)

## ideas for additional features
### Guided Shutdown
When I shutdown my computer, Windows 10, unlike Windows 7 and previous versions will switch to Logon-UI.

If any apps are still running and progress is unsaved it will tell you there.
 
I really wish it didn't do that, because it makes it take longer. Additionally I don't like the feeling of having to cancel the shutdown process to close a few Windows.
  
IMO, it should scale the desktop to be smaller and on the right hand side and bottom it could guide you through saving unfinished progress, as well as allowing to go fullscreen while still being able to go back into Shutdown mode the same way as well as to cancel the entire shutdown process. ‚Äî On the right it would say something like "AppTitle still has unfinished business with you" and at the bottom it could point to the position on the taskbar you need to go to fix the issue.

The place to activate it (assuming it is optional) should be within "System", in the newfangled ControlPanel.

P.S: I personally consider it a design flaw that you are not at least given a choice of this when setting up your computer for the first time.
