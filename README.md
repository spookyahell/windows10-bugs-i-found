Possibly/maybe. I'm tired sometimes, that could lead to errors of judgment and bugs could turn out to be misbehavior of my own.

Also, may not be using the latest version of the OS at time of report.


## unconfirmed BUGs üêõ
- When I shutdown my computer it switches to tell me I still have apps open, I click cancel, it shuts down nonetheless.

- When I shutdown my computer it switches to tell me I still have apps open, I click cancel, it calims to be shutting down for a second, then cancels.


## confirmed BUGs üêõ 
- 

## design flaws imo
- When I shutdown my computer, Windows 10, unlike Windows 7 and previous versions will switch to Logon-UI.

  If any apps are still running and progress is unsaved it will tell you there.
  I really wish it didn't do that, because it makes it take longer.
  IMO, it should scale the desktop to be smaller and on the right hand side and bottom it could guide you through saving unfinished progress, as well as allowing to go fullscreen while still going back into Shutdown mode the same way as well as to cancel the entire shutdown process.
